# Overview #
The intent of this project is provide a high quality 100% JavaScript implementation of Sudoku that can run on many platforms (e.g. cross browser, iPhone, Facebook, Android, etc.). The central design philosophy is small, independent, well named, testable and reusable components. Different scenarios require different implementations (e.g. touch vs. keyboard on an iPhone) and the goal is for these components to be configurable and CSS based.

This project will be expanded to include a server side component that is based on Spring 3.0 REST/MVC and backed with Google AppEngine.
